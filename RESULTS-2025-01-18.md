# Results 2025-01-18

Results of running the 4 unit tests in GrabConcurrencyTest
on two OSes (Mac and Windows). Summary at the end.

In a nutshell, the tests try to download artifacts
`com.google.guava:guava:guava-10.0` to `...:19` in 100 threads
of which 10 threads try with each artifact via Grape.
Tests always start with an empty Grape cache.

Outputs of these tests are at `test-results/2025-01-18`.

### testParallelGrabs_oldDefaultGrapeConfig<br>

This tests the old/current behavior
with the current `defaultGrapeConfig.xml`.

Almost immediately get exceptions and partial downloads
(e.g. test-grape-root/grapes/com.google.guava/guava/jars/guava-11.0.jar.part).

Usually does not recover, i.e. some threads hang indefinitely,
and getting the related artifacts no longer possible,
except presumably by manually deleting them from the cache.

### testParallelGrabs_newDefaultGrapeConfig

This tests the new behavior with the change from MR 2142
which adds `<caches lockStrategy="artifact-lock-nio"/>`
to the `defaultGrapeConfig.xml`.

Sometimes the test passes without exceptions.
Of these tests that pass, some take roughly the time it takes
to download all 10 artifacts one after the other,
others can take quite a bit longer, something
like maybe 80 sec instead of 10 secs, with several
threads hanging for a while in between.

But more often the test does not pass.
Most often with partial downloads as above,
with usually the effect that one thread hangs forever,
most likely the one that got somehow stuck while downloading,
while other threads waiting to download the same artifact
terminate with an exception after about 5 minutes
(presumably there is a timeout).

As in the test method above,
getting the artifacts where a thread hangs indefinitely
is no longer possible, except presumably by
manually deleting them from the cache.

### testParallelGrabs_oldDefaultGrapeConfigPlusGrengineLocking and testParallelGrabs_newDefaultGrapeConfigPlusGrengineLocking

These are just for reference.
They are using the locking mechanism
of [Grengine](https://grengine.ch),
which is a lock for all grabs within the same loaded
Grape and Ivy classes.
With that, tests always pass without delay except
sequential downloads of the 10 artifacts.
(Of course, that would be no solution across class loaders
or processes.)

```java
try {
  Grengine.Grape.activate();
  // do grabs as needed, incl. running Groovy scripts that do...
} finally {
  Grengine.Grape.deactivate();
}
```

## Summary

Appears that Ivy's `artifact-lock-nio` locking is buggy:
It works to some degree, but can still lead to problems in practice.

(I remember that I had already tried this setting a few years ago
in a container ([Jexler](https://grengine.ch/jexler/))
that would start several grabbing) Groovy scripts
each in their own threads when starting,
and I still had issues then, i.e. I know of at least one practical
example where using `artifact-lock-nio` is not good enough.
